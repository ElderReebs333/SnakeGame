# SnakeGame
Basic version of the classic snake game created with Python. This was really fun and I can't wait to do more classic games like this! 

This project is using Turtle instead of Pygame. We create variables that keep track of the score/highscore and home screen, and then make the different objects.
We create a simple head of the snake and then the food. For creating the "score" and "high score" on the screen we created
a "pen" object. We used multipled functions to get the head to go multiple directions. The keyboard bindings were necessary so that we could interact with the snake
when we wanted to move it. The most important part of the project was the while loop in the main section. We created a while loop which was necessary for the animation to take place.
The delay variable was necessary to keep track of the speed of the worm/snake.
